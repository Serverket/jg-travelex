# Tracking Module Notes

## Potential Directions
- Real-time trip board dedicated to dispatchers with order-linked alerts.
- Driver timeline view that combines completed, active, and scheduled trips per operator.
- Exportable operations log that aggregates distance, duration, and revenue by client.

## Retired Experiments
- TripTracking.jsx page with status insight cards and operational alerts (removed 2026-01-05 because dashboard now covers the same metrics).
- Navigation-level feature flag named "tracking" (retired with the page to avoid unused permissions).
